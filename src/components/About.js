            About Me
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-4">I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for learning.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My interest in software engineering started to blossom as I began looking further into potential solutions to problems in the L&D field. I want to have a career where I can contribute hands-on to solutions in both the education field and beyond. My long term goal is to create apps that improve the way we learn and grow. <span role="img" aria-label="learn and grow">ðŸŒ± ðŸš€</span>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before transitioning into web development, I worked as a supervisor of over 300+ international educators at Tokyo Global Gateway. Leading this initiative taught me how to work within a diverse team while also meeting the high standards of stakeholders such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education and Gakken Holdings.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Besides my managerial work, I have also been able to work as an Educational Specialist where I have been able to create and deliver educational programs to thousands of students across Japan. A large majority of these programs have included both programming and design, as I have aimed to increase the understanding of basic programming concepts amongst young learners.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Currently, I am working on developing apps for various projects while also pursuing a full-time role in web development.
            When I'm not coding, you can find me walking my dog or eating at one of my favorite restaurants around Tokyo.
