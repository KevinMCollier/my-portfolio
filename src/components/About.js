          I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for learning.
          <br />
          My interest in software engineering started to blossom as I began looking further into potential solutions to problems in the L&D field. At this point, I knew that I wanted to have a career where I could contribute hands-on to these solutions.
          <br />
          My long term goal is to create apps that improve the way we learn and grow. ðŸŒ± ðŸš€
